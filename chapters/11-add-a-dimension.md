# Let's Add a Dimension

Another cool thing about distance functions: everything you've learn so far generalises to 3D! Using a technique called [raymarching](http://jamie-wong.com/2016/07/15/ray-marching-signed-distance-functions/) we can draw out a 3D distance function entirely in a fragment shader.

We've hidden the code that does this because it can be a lot to take on at once, but you can find a bunch of examples online. To name a few:
